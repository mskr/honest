A honest computer program for learning

Honest computer program: 

Hi, I m a C program runnig on a time-sharing system, probably Windows or Linux, maybe Anroid or iOS.
 
Regardless, this system uses its computing resources in a way that works for multiple programs like me. 

That means, it gives me time slices, that I can spent on the CPU and other devices, like waiting for keyboard input or sending text or pixels to the screen. 

I am the instructions that it keeps in RAM, together with the data, that I am consuming or producing directly. 

I say directly, because I need this data coming from you or elsewhere first in the main memory space, that the system gave to me, after you decided to invoke me. 

Me too, I came from another memory, before I was loaded. And so is my data - nothing stays here for a longer time, but everything has to live elsewhere when runtime is over - like this text lives for a short amount of time, first in my memory and then on your screen, where I sent it for you. 

Sorry for the spelling mistakes. I want to be honest with you. 

A computer system is about resources in time and "space"/memory. Both are limited. 

And so it is you judgeing the performance in terms of the efficiency, with which the system uses these resources. 

Programs like me can make it easy or hard for the system by the way we are using resources. 

I want to show you, how large the time slices were, that I got from the system, and how large the times between them, that the system used to reiceive input from you, let other programs run or waited for the sceen to display the text I sent. 

Here is a chart. 

... 

Just for context: I know of #### other programs currently running, you pressed ## keys and moved the mouse ### pixels during my runtime, and I sent ### characters.

Now let me show you how energy efficient your computer is.
